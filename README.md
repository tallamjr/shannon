# `shannon`: Collection of Compression Algorithms

![]( https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/digital_data.png)

This repository is to serve as a collection of compression algorithms implemented in **Python** and/or
**Rust** as a learning exercise.

#### Book

In addition, I am putting together (very work-in-progress) book where I will jot down concepts and
toy problems I come across, which will hopefully improve my understandings.  This is built with
[Jupyter-Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) using this [website](https://whitead.github.io/dmol-book/)
as inspiration.

This can build locally with:

```bash
$ cd book && jupyterbook build . && open _build/html/index.html
```
Alternatively, visit www.compression-cookbook.com
